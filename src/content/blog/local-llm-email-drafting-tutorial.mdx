AI drafting doesn't have to mean compromising your privacy. Here's how to use local models to write better emails.

We've all seen the magic of ChatGPT or Gemini drafting emails. It's powerful, but it comes with a catch: you're handing over your private thoughts, tone, and correspondence to a cloud provider. For many of us, that's a deal-breaker.

The solution is **Local LLMs**. These are Large Language Models that run entirely on your Mac's hardware. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to integrate them into your daily workflow.

## Step 1: The Right Hardware

To run high-quality local models like Llama 3 or Mistral, you need a Mac with Apple Silicon (M1, M2, or M3 series). These chips contain a "Unified Memory Architecture" that allows the GPU to access the same memory as the CPU, which is critical for running AI models efficiently.

## Step 2: Choosing Your Model

Not all local models are equal. For email drafting, we recommend models in the 7B (7 billion) parameter range. They strike the perfect balance between speed and intelligence.

- **Llama 3 (8B):** Great for creative writing and professional tone.
- **Mistral (7B):** Excellent for concise summaries and direct replies.

## Step 3: Drafting Your First Email

In Inboxed, the process is simple. When you click "Reply," you'll see a small AI icon in the composer.

1. **Select Your Context:** The AI automatically reads the previous thread context (locally!) to understand the conversation.
2. **Provide a Prompt:** Instead of writing the whole email, just type a few notes like: *"Accept the meeting for Tuesday at 2 PM but ask for an agenda first."*
3. **Generate:** The local model will generate a full, professional draft in seconds.

## Step 4: Refining the Tone

One advantage of local AI is that you can quickly "rerun" the generation with different parameters without worrying about API costs or token limits. You can toggle between "Professional," "Casual," or "Concise" until the draft feels just right.

## Why This Matters

When you draft locally, your unfinished thoughts, your rough notes, and your final message never leave your device. You get the productivity boost of AI with the peace of mind of absolute privacy.

Drafting with local AI isn't just a gimmick—it's the responsible way to use intelligence in your professional life.
