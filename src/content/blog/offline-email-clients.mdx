You're on a plane. WiFi costs $15 and barely works. That critical client email needs a thoughtful response. What do you do?

If you rely on Gmail in a browser, you stare at a loading spinner. If you use a native email client with offline support, you draft the reply, queue it, and move on with your life. The email sends automatically when you reconnect.

But not all offline email is created equal. Some apps let you read cached messages. Others let you compose. And one lets you do everything — including AI-powered summaries, smart replies, and semantic search — without a single byte of internet traffic.

## Why Offline Email Still Matters in 2026

You might think reliable connectivity is everywhere by now. It isn't. Remote work has pushed people into cabins, co-working spaces in developing countries, and cross-continental flights. Digital nomads number in the tens of millions. And even in major cities, underground commutes, conference centers, and overloaded public WiFi routinely kill your connection.

Here's when offline email becomes essential:

- **Air travel:** Flights longer than two hours without usable WiFi are common, especially on international routes. You need to read, reply, and organize during that time.
- **Remote and rural work:** Working from a mountain town or coastal retreat means spotty connectivity. Offline email lets you batch-process your inbox during dead zones.
- **Commuting underground:** Subway systems in most cities still lack consistent cellular or WiFi coverage. That's 30-60 minutes per day you could spend clearing email.
- **Conference and event venues:** Overcrowded WiFi at conferences is practically unusable. If you need to follow up with a contact you just met, you need offline compose.
- **Security-conscious environments:** Public WiFi networks are attack surfaces. Every API call your email client makes over hotel WiFi is a potential vulnerability. Offline-first architecture eliminates that risk entirely.

## Levels of Offline Support

Not all "offline" modes are equal. There's a spectrum of capability, and understanding it helps you choose the right tool.

### Level 1: Read Cached Emails

Most web-based email clients offer this at best. Gmail's offline mode, for example, requires a Chrome extension and only caches a limited window of recent messages. You can read what was already loaded, but you can't compose, search effectively, or access older threads. It's better than nothing, but barely.

### Level 2: Read + Compose

Native desktop clients like Apple Mail and Outlook let you read synced messages and compose new ones while offline. Drafts sit in your outbox and send when connectivity returns. This covers the basics for most people — but search is limited to whatever has been indexed locally, and there's no intelligence layer.

### Level 3: Read + Compose + Full Search

IMAP clients with a complete local index — like Thunderbird with all folders synced — let you search your entire email history offline. This is a meaningful upgrade. You can find that attachment from six months ago without an internet connection. But there's still no AI assistance: no summaries, no smart replies, no intelligent categorization.

### Level 4: Full AI Intelligence Offline

This is where [Inboxed](/) stands alone. By running local LLMs (Llama 3, Mistral) directly on your Mac's GPU via Apple MLX and Metal, Inboxed delivers AI summaries, smart reply drafts, semantic search, and email categorization — all without touching the internet. Your emails never leave your device, and the AI never makes a cloud API call.

## Offline Email Client Comparison

Let's examine how each major email client handles offline use in practice.

### Gmail (Web)

Gmail's offline mode requires enabling a Chrome extension and only works in the Chrome browser. It caches emails from the last 7, 30, or 90 days depending on your settings. You can read and compose, but search is severely limited, attachments may not be available, and the experience feels like a stripped-down version of the full product.

Verdict: **Level 1.** Barely functional offline. Not suitable for serious offline work.

### Apple Mail

Apple Mail syncs your inbox locally via IMAP and gives you solid read and compose capability offline. Drafts queue in the outbox. With Apple Intelligence on M-series Macs, you get basic on-device features like Smart Reply suggestions — but no summarization, no semantic search, and limited categorization.

Verdict: **Level 2.** Reliable for basic offline email, but no AI intelligence.

### Thunderbird

Thunderbird is the gold standard for traditional offline email. It syncs all IMAP folders locally, builds a full-text search index, and lets you read, compose, and search your entire archive without internet. Extensions add PGP encryption and custom workflows.

Verdict: **Level 3.** Excellent offline fundamentals with full local search, but zero AI capability.

### Spark

Spark caches recent emails for offline reading and lets you compose drafts. But its AI features — smart replies, summaries, and prioritization — all require an internet connection because they run on Readdle's cloud servers. Your emails are stored on their servers for processing, which raises privacy concerns even when you are online.

Verdict: **Level 1-2.** Limited offline caching. AI is cloud-only.

### Superhuman

Superhuman is built for speed — when you have internet. Its AI features (Instant Reply, email summaries, auto-categorization) all run via cloud APIs. Take the WiFi away, and you lose the features that justify the $30/month price tag. Basic reading and composing work offline, but the experience is dramatically diminished.

Verdict: **Level 2.** Read and compose offline, but AI goes dark without internet.

### Inboxed

Inboxed was designed offline-first from the ground up. The Rust-powered IMAP engine syncs your complete email archive locally. The local LLM runs on your Mac's GPU using Apple MLX — no internet required for AI summaries, smart reply drafts, semantic search, or email categorization. Everything works at 30,000 feet exactly as it does at your desk.

Verdict: **Level 4.** Full AI intelligence offline. The only email client that doesn't degrade without internet.

## The Travel Email Workflow

Whether you're a digital nomad, a business traveler, or just commuting through a dead zone, here's a practical workflow for managing email with limited connectivity.

### Before You Disconnect

- **Force a full sync.** Open your email client and let it download all new messages and attachments while you still have WiFi. With Inboxed, this happens automatically — the Rust IMAP engine syncs in the background.
- **Download key attachments.** If you know you'll need specific files, open them once so they're cached locally.
- **Check your outbox.** Make sure any pending drafts have been sent before you lose connectivity.

### While Offline

- **Triage with AI summaries.** Use Inboxed's local AI to generate summaries of long threads. Quickly identify what needs a response now versus what can wait.
- **Draft replies using smart suggestions.** The on-device LLM generates contextual reply drafts. Edit them to your voice and queue them in the outbox.
- **Search semantically.** Need to find that contract discussion from last quarter? Inboxed's local semantic search understands meaning, not just keywords. Search for "vendor pricing negotiation" and find the right thread even if those exact words never appeared.
- **Organize and categorize.** Label, archive, and sort emails. All changes sync when you reconnect.

### When You Reconnect

- **Queued emails send automatically.** Everything in your outbox fires off instantly.
- **New emails sync in.** The client pulls down anything that arrived while you were offline.
- **Local changes propagate.** Labels, archives, and deletions sync to your IMAP server.

## Security Benefits of Offline AI

There's a security angle to offline email that most people overlook. When your email client's AI features require internet, every query you make — every summary generated, every smart reply drafted — sends data over the network. On hotel WiFi, airport networks, or conference hotspots, that's a real risk.

- **No API calls over public networks.** Cloud-based AI email clients send your email content to OpenAI, Google, or proprietary servers. On a compromised network, that traffic can be intercepted. With local AI, nothing leaves your machine.
- **No man-in-the-middle exposure.** Even with TLS, sophisticated attacks on public WiFi can intercept API traffic. Offline AI eliminates the attack surface entirely.
- **No data at rest on third-party servers.** Some email clients (like Spark) store your emails on their own servers for AI processing. That's another target. Inboxed keeps everything on your local SSD, encrypted by macOS FileVault.
- **Compliance-friendly.** For professionals in healthcare, legal, or finance, sending email content to cloud AI services can violate HIPAA, attorney-client privilege, or financial regulations. Local AI sidesteps the issue completely.

Put simply: the most secure AI email is one that never connects to a server. That's Inboxed.

## Quick Comparison: Offline Capabilities

- **Gmail (Web):** Level 1 — Read cached only, Chrome extension required
- **Apple Mail:** Level 2 — Read + compose, no AI offline
- **Thunderbird:** Level 3 — Read + compose + full search, no AI
- **Spark:** Level 1-2 — Limited cache, AI requires internet
- **Superhuman:** Level 2 — Read + compose, AI requires internet
- **Inboxed:** Level 4 — Full offline including AI summaries, smart replies, semantic search

## The Bottom Line

If you travel, commute, or work anywhere with unreliable internet, your email client's offline capability matters more than almost any other feature. Most clients treat offline as an afterthought — a degraded mode you tolerate until WiFi returns.

[Inboxed](/) treats offline as the default. The local LLM on your Mac's GPU doesn't know or care whether you have internet. Summaries generate instantly. Smart replies draft in milliseconds. Semantic search finds what you need. And none of it requires a single network request.

Your email should work as hard as you do — even at 30,000 feet.
