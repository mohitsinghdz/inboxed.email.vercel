At $30/month, Superhuman is the most expensive email client on the market. Is it worth $360/year? Let's break it down honestly.

## What Superhuman Does Well

Let's be fair: Superhuman is genuinely impressive. The speed is remarkable — emails load instantly, searches happen in real-time, and the entire interface feels buttery smooth. This isn't marketing hype; it's a well-engineered product.

The keyboard-first design is thoughtful, with 100+ shortcuts that cover virtually every action. AI auto-drafts save time. Auto-summaries distill long threads. The split inbox helps you focus. And the onboarding experience? It's premium — they literally walk you through setup on a video call.

For high-volume emailers — investors, executives, sales teams — Superhuman truly saves time. It's not snake oil.

## What You're Paying For

That $360/year isn't arbitrary. You're paying for cloud infrastructure to run AI models, a design and UX team that obsesses over details, premium customer onboarding, and multi-platform support (web, Mac, Windows, iOS).

Every time you generate an email summary or AI draft, that request goes to servers running large language models. Those servers cost money. The $30/month is essentially renting access to someone else's compute power.

## The Privacy Question

Here's the part Superhuman doesn't advertise prominently: their AI runs on cloud servers powered by OpenAI. Every email summary, every draft, every search query passes through third-party infrastructure.

Your private correspondence — client communications, legal matters, financial details — is processed on computers you don't control. For lawyers, doctors, investors, or anyone handling sensitive information, this is a deal-breaker.

Even with strict privacy policies, data breaches happen. Sub-processors change. Terms evolve. You're trusting not just Superhuman, but also their vendors.

## Free Alternatives That Match Up

The good news? You don't have to choose between intelligence and privacy, or between features and cost. Here are the real alternatives:

- **Inboxed** — Same speed, local AI, free. The closest Superhuman experience without the cost or cloud dependency. [Compare directly here](/compare/superhuman). Keyboard shortcuts, AI summaries, smart replies — all on-device. Runs on Rust, optimized for Apple Silicon, uses ~50MB of RAM instead of 200MB+.
- **Apple Mail** — Free, native, private. But no AI features. Best for minimalists who don't need intelligent assistance and just want a clean, fast email experience.
- **Thunderbird** — Free, open source, respects privacy. But the interface feels dated, and there's no AI. Good for those who value control and customization over modern features.

## Inboxed vs Superhuman: Feature-by-Feature

Here's the direct comparison:

- **AI:** Cloud (Superhuman) vs Local (Inboxed) — both deliver summaries and smart replies, but only Inboxed keeps data on your device
- **Speed:** Both fast — Superhuman uses Electron, Inboxed uses Rust for even lower resource usage
- **Shortcuts:** Both keyboard-first with extensive shortcut support
- **Cost:** $360/year vs Free
- **Privacy:** Cloud-processed vs On-device
- **RAM:** ~200MB vs ~50MB

## Who Should Still Use Superhuman?

To be balanced: if you're embedded in a Gmail/Google Workspace team environment, need deep integrations with Salesforce or HubSpot, and privacy isn't a top concern, Superhuman is genuinely great.

If you're managing 200+ emails a day, work in a fast-paced startup, and want white-glove onboarding, the $30/month might be worth it.

For everyone else, there are better options.

## The Verdict

Superhuman is an excellent product at a premium price point. The team built something genuinely impressive. But with local AI advancing rapidly, paying $360/year for cloud-based intelligence is increasingly hard to justify.

You can get the same speed, the same keyboard-first workflow, and AI-powered features — without giving up privacy or paying a subscription. [Explore all Superhuman alternatives here](/alternatives/superhuman-alternatives).
