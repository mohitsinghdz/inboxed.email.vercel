Most people think email is private. It isn't. Here's what's really happening with your data.

Every day, billions of emails flow through servers owned by companies you've never heard of. They're scanned, analyzed, and processed by AI systems that know more about your life than your closest friends. The question isn't whether your email is being read—it's who's reading it, and what they're doing with it.

## Who's Reading Your Email?

Let's start with the uncomfortable truth: almost every modern email service reads your messages. Not humans (usually), but automated systems that treat your inbox as a data source.

**Gmail** famously scanned emails for advertising until 2017. They stopped targeting ads based on email content, but the scanning never stopped—it just shifted to powering "smart" features like Smart Reply and categorization. Google's AI still reads every message to make the product better.

**[Superhuman](/compare/superhuman)** processes your emails through OpenAI's APIs. When you use AI features, your email content is sent to OpenAI's servers. It's in the [privacy policy](/compare/superhuman)—most users just don't read it.

**[Spark](/compare/spark)** stores your email credentials and message data on Readdle's servers to enable cross-device sync. Your emails don't just live on your device—they're copied to a third-party infrastructure you don't control.

## The Three Layers of Email Privacy

Email privacy isn't binary. It exists in layers, and understanding them is key to making informed choices.

### Layer 1: Transport Encryption (TLS)

This is the baseline. When you see that padlock icon in your browser, it means your connection to the email server is encrypted. Gmail, Outlook, Fastmail—everyone has this. It protects your email in transit, but once it hits the server, all bets are off.

TLS prevents someone from intercepting your email as it travels across the internet. It doesn't prevent the email provider from reading it.

### Layer 2: End-to-End Encryption (PGP/S-MIME)

This is what [Proton Mail](/compare/proton-mail) offers. Your email is encrypted on your device, transmitted in encrypted form, and can only be decrypted by the recipient. Even the email provider can't read it.

The catch? Both sender and recipient need to support it. If you send an encrypted email to someone on Gmail, you're back to square one. End-to-end encryption is powerful but requires buy-in from everyone in the chain.

### Layer 3: Processing Privacy

This is the new frontier, and where AI makes everything complicated. Even if your email provider doesn't read your messages, what happens when you use AI features?

Email summarization, smart replies, automatic categorization—these features require reading your email. The question is: *where* does that processing happen?

## The AI Privacy Paradox

Here's the paradox: AI needs to read your emails to help you. The more intelligent your email client becomes, the more access it needs to your data.

Traditional cloud AI creates a devil's bargain. Want AI-powered email summaries? Send your messages to OpenAI. Want smart categorization? Let Google's models scan your inbox. Want cross-device sync with AI features? Upload everything to a company's servers.

The paradox is simple: **the smarter your email client, the less private it becomes.**

Unless...

## Local AI: The Third Way

Apple Silicon changed everything. Modern MacBooks can run 7B+ parameter language models locally—no cloud required. What used to demand a datacenter now fits on your laptop.

This unlocks a third option: **on-device AI processing.** The intelligence comes to your data instead of your data going to the intelligence.

Inboxed uses **llama.cpp** optimized with Apple Metal to run models like Llama 3 and Mistral directly on your Mac. When you ask for an email summary:

- The email never leaves your device
- No API calls are made
- No logs are created on remote servers
- No data retention policies apply because there's nothing to retain

Your network activity is zero. You can verify this with tools like Little Snitch or Wireshark. When Inboxed processes your email, your network interface stays silent.

## What to Look For in a Private Email Client

Not all email clients are created equal. Here's what to evaluate:

### 1. Where does AI processing happen?

This is the most critical question. Does the app process emails on your device, or does it send them to cloud servers? Check the privacy policy. Look for phrases like "third-party AI providers" or "cloud processing."

### 2. Does the app store your emails on their servers?

Some clients cache or store your emails on company-owned infrastructure for sync or search features. [Spark does this](/compare/spark). It's convenient, but it means your data exists in multiple places.

### 3. Is there telemetry or analytics?

Even privacy-focused apps often collect "anonymized" usage data. Read the privacy policy. Check if you can disable telemetry completely. If the app is open source, audit what it's actually sending.

### 4. Can you verify network traffic?

Use tools like Little Snitch, Wireshark, or Charles Proxy to monitor what your email client actually sends over the network. Privacy claims are worthless if you can't verify them.

### 5. What's the business model?

If the product is free, you're likely the product. [Gmail is free](/compare/gmail) because Google monetizes your data for advertising. Paid products align incentives—you pay for the software, not with your privacy.

## Privacy-First Email Setup for 2026

Here's a practical, actionable setup for maximum email privacy:

### Step 1: Choose a Privacy-Respecting Email Provider

Your email provider is your foundation. Consider:

- **Fastmail:** Privacy-focused, no ads, no scanning. Paid service with strong encryption.
- **[Proton Mail](/compare/proton-mail):** End-to-end encryption, open source, based in Switzerland with strong privacy laws.
- **iCloud Mail with iCloud+:** Apple doesn't monetize your data and offers features like Hide My Email.

### Step 2: Use a Local AI Email Client

Pair your private email provider with an email client that processes everything on-device. Inboxed is built for this—local AI summaries, categorization, and search without cloud dependencies.

### Step 3: Enable Two-Factor Authentication

Privacy means nothing if someone can hijack your account. Use hardware keys (YubiKey) or authenticator apps (Authy, 1Password). Never use SMS-based 2FA if you can avoid it.

### Step 4: Block Tracking Pixels

Email tracking pixels are invisible images embedded in emails that tell senders when you open their message, where you are, and what device you're using. Many email clients now block these by default—make sure yours does.

### Step 5: Audit Your Email Client's Network Activity

Don't take privacy claims at face value. Install Little Snitch or use Wireshark to monitor what your email client actually does. If it's truly private, you'll see it connect only to your email server—nothing else.

Email privacy in 2026 isn't about choosing between convenience and security—it's about choosing tools that respect both.
