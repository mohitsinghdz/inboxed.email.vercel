AI email clients are everywhere in 2026. But they're not all equal when it comes to privacy. We ranked every major option by how they actually handle your data.

## How We Ranked Them

This isn't a ranking of features or polish. It's a privacy-first analysis based on four criteria:

- **Privacy Architecture:** Is the AI running locally on your device, or in the cloud?
- **Data Retention:** What happens to your emails after processing? Are they stored, logged, or used for training?
- **Transparency:** Do they clearly explain their AI infrastructure, or hide behind vague marketing?
- **AI Capability:** How powerful are the models? Are they actually useful or just gimmicks?

If you care about privacy, where your data lives matters more than how pretty the UI is.

## 1. Inboxed — 100% Local AI (The Gold Standard)

[Inboxed](/) runs 7B+ parameter models (Llama 3, Mistral) entirely on your Mac using Apple MLX and Metal GPU acceleration. Built with Rust and Tauri, it's engineered for Apple Silicon.

**Privacy:** Zero data exit. Your emails never touch a cloud server. The AI comes to your data, not the other way around.

**Features:** Email summarization, smart replies, thread analysis, priority detection — all offline, even on a plane.

**Cost:** Free. $1/month for Pro features (no recurring cloud costs, just supporting development).

**Why it's #1:** The only client running frontier-class models 100% on-device. If you value ownership and privacy, this is the gold standard.

## 2. Apple Mail — Private but Limited

Apple Mail with Apple Intelligence offers on-device AI features like Smart Reply and priority sorting. Processing happens locally on your iPhone or Mac.

**Privacy:** Excellent. Apple doesn't scan your emails for ads or share data with third parties.

**Limitations:** AI features are basic compared to dedicated clients. No third-party AI integrations. No advanced summarization or thread intelligence.

**Cost:** Free with macOS/iOS.

**Best for:** Users who want privacy and don't need advanced AI features.

## 3. Canary Mail — Marketed as Private, Cloud-Powered

[Canary Mail](/compare/canary-mail) markets itself as a privacy-focused client, but its AI features rely on cloud APIs.

**Privacy:** AI-generated summaries and replies are processed through cloud services (likely OpenAI or similar). Your email content is transmitted off-device.

**Features:** Smart compose, email templates, read receipts, PGP encryption (unrelated to AI).

**Cost:** $20/year.

**The disconnect:** They emphasize encryption and privacy in marketing, but their AI is cloud-dependent. Read the fine print.

## 4. Spark — Polished but Cloud-Dependent

[Spark](/compare/spark) by Readdle is beautifully designed with smart inbox features and AI summaries.

**Privacy:** Your emails are stored on Readdle's servers for sync and AI processing. AI features use OpenAI's GPT models via cloud APIs.

**Features:** Email categorization, smart notifications, AI replies, team collaboration.

**Cost:** $59/year for Premium.

**Trade-off:** Great UX and powerful features, but you're trusting Readdle with your email data.

## 5. Superhuman — Premium Cloud AI

[Superhuman](/compare/superhuman) is the fastest, most polished email client, with AI-powered triage, snippets, and instant replies.

**Privacy:** AI features are powered by OpenAI's cloud models. Your emails are processed on Superhuman's servers and sent to third-party AI providers.

**Features:** Blazing-fast keyboard shortcuts, read receipts, send later, AI triage, auto-followup.

**Cost:** $30/month ($360/year).

**Who it's for:** Executives who prioritize speed over privacy and can afford the premium.

## 6. Gmail — AI at the Cost of Your Data

[Gmail](/compare/gmail) with Gemini AI offers smart compose, auto-replies, and inbox categorization.

**Privacy:** Google scans your emails to power AI features and serve targeted ads. Your data is used to train models and build advertising profiles.

**Features:** Powerful AI, excellent spam filtering, deep integration with Google Workspace.

**Cost:** Free (you pay with your data).

**The reality:** If you're not paying, you're the product. Gmail's AI is powerful because it's trained on billions of emails — including yours.

## The Privacy Spectrum

Here's how these clients fall on the privacy spectrum:

- **Fully Local:** Inboxed (100% on-device AI, zero cloud dependency)
- **Private but Limited:** Apple Mail (on-device, but basic features)
- **Hybrid Privacy:** Canary Mail (claims privacy, AI is cloud-based)
- **Cloud-First:** Spark (stores emails on servers, cloud AI)
- **Premium Cloud:** Superhuman (fast and polished, fully cloud-dependent)
- **Data Monetization:** Gmail (free, but scans everything for ads and training)

## Our Recommendation

If privacy matters to you — and it should — choose an email client with local AI.

[Inboxed](/) is the only client running 7B+ parameter models entirely on-device. No cloud APIs. No data logging. No monthly subscription to rent someone else's GPU.

For professionals in legal, medical, finance, or journalism, this isn't just a feature — it's a requirement.

The future of AI email isn't in the cloud. It's on your device. And it's available today.
