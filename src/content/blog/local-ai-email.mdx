We've accepted a dangerous tradeoff: to get smart features, we give up our privacy. It doesn't have to be this way.

Tools like Superhuman or Gmail's AI features work by sending your email data to cloud servers.
They process your private correspondence on computers you don't own, often retaining data for "training" or "quality assurance."

## The Cloud AI Problem

When you use a cloud-based AI wrapper, you are effectively CC'ing a third party on every email.
Even with "strict" privacy policies, data breaches happen. Sub-processors change. Terms of service evolve.

For legal, medical, or high-security professions, this is a non-starter.

## The Local Private LLM Solution

Apple Silicon and modern hardware have changed the game. We can now run powerful 7B+ parameter models (like Llama 3 or Mistral) directly on your MacBook.

- **Zero Data Exit:** Your emails never leave your device. The AI comes to your data, not the other way around.
- **No Latency:** No network requests. Summarization happens instantly, even offline on a plane.
- **Cost:** You pay for your hardware once. You shouldn't pay a monthly subscription just to rent someone else's GPU.

## Engineered for Silicon

Inboxed is built with Rust and Tauri to be extremely lightweight. We use **llama.cpp** optimized with Apple Metal to tap into the Neural Engine and GPU of your Mac.

This isn't a web wrapper. It's a native tool for professionals who value ownership.
