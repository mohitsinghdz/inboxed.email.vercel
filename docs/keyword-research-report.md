3. **"on-device ai email client"** -- Completely unclaimed.
4. **"email that ai can't read"** -- Plays on fear/privacy, no one targets this.
5. **"privacy first email client mac"** -- Canary touches this but doesn't dominate.
6. **"email app no cloud ai"** -- Unique differentiator for Inboxed.
7. **"mac email app that respects privacy"** -- Emotional/values-based search.

### Content Type Distribution

- **4 Comparison Landing Pages** (superhuman, apple mail, gmail, outlook alternatives)
- **3 Feature Landing Pages** (AI email, privacy, local AI)
- **1 Core Landing Page** (best email client for mac)
- **12+ Blog Posts** over first 3 months (privacy, productivity, AI explainers)
- **2-3 FAQ Pages** (email privacy FAQs, AI email FAQs)

### Key Strategic Notes

1. **The Gmail/Gemini Privacy Story Is Your Biggest Opportunity Right Now.** The November 2025 Malwarebytes revelation that Gmail reads emails/attachments for "smart features" created ongoing search demand. Inboxed's zero-data-exit architecture is the perfect answer.

2. **"On-Device AI" Is the Keyword Category to Own.** With 78% of users refusing cloud AI features and Apple pushing NPU-powered local AI, this category will explode. Inboxed should be the first email client to dominate these SERPs.

3. **Superhuman's $30/month Price Creates a Massive Alternative-Seeking Audience.** Every "superhuman alternative" search represents a buyer who wants a premium email experience but questions the value. Position Inboxed as "Superhuman-level speed, none of the cloud dependency."

4. **Apple Mail Frustration Is at an All-Time High.** macOS updates in 2024-2025 caused widespread sync and performance issues. Thousands of users are actively searching for replacements. Target these users with empathetic, solution-oriented content.

5. **Build Topic Authority Through Clusters, Not Isolated Posts.** Group content into the 5 clusters identified above (Email Privacy, Inbox Zero, AI Email, On-Device AI, Mac Email Apps) and interlink heavily to build topical authority signals for Google.
